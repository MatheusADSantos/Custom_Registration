# Registration Custom

Registration Custom is a registration page to incorporate an automation project - CI (Continuous Integration)

## Installation

- You need install some like [XAMP](https://www.apachefriends.org/pt_br/index.html) to upload a server
If you use a macbook, then prefer [MAMP](https://www.mamp.info/en/windows/)

- You need download and install a framework called [Codeigniter](https://codeigniter.com/download), in my case I'd used at version 3

- After unzip a codeigniter, move to .../MAMP/htdocs/
And rename this directory if you wanna...

- Maybe you need to see a [tutorial](https://codeigniter.com/userguide3/tutorial) to how use a framework 


```
